# CS571-project: Book Reviews Analysis with Text Clustering

## Overview

This project explores the content analysis of book reviews by professional reviewers and Amazon consumers. We utilized Fine-tuned BERT combined with K-Means clustering to categorize sentences from these reviews into eight distinct clusters. The analysis revealed that content similarities exist not only within reviews of the same book but also between professional and consumer reviews, highlighting the potential of using NLP techniques to assess the quality and consistency of online book reviews.

## Key Features

· **Datasets:** Analysis of New York Times and Amazon book reviews.  
· **Models:** Fine-tuned BERT with K-Means for sentence-level clustering.  
· **Findings:** High content similarity across different types of reviews.  

## Usage

The notebook in this repository includes the data preprocessing steps, model training, and clustering analysis used in the study.
