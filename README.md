# CS571-project: Book Reviews Analysis with Text Clustering

## Overview

This project focuses on content analysis of book reviews written by both professional reviewers and Amazon consumers. We applied Fine-tuned BERT and K-Means to cluster the reviews at the sentence level into eight distinct clusters. Our analysis revealed that reviews for the same book share significant content similarities, and the content between professional and consumer reviews is also closely aligned, demonstrating the effectiveness of our text clustering approach.
